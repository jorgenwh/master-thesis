abstract = "Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) projects, such as the 1000
            Genomes Project, are already revolutionizing our understanding of
            genetic variation among individuals. However, the massive data
            sets generated by NGS--the 1000 Genome pilot alone includes
            nearly five terabases--make writing feature-rich, efficient, and
            robust analysis tools difficult for even computationally
            sophisticated individuals. Indeed, many professionals are limited
            in the scope and the ease with which they can answer scientific
            questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating the
            data produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome
            Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a structured programming framework
            designed to ease the development of efficient and robust analysis
            tools for next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional
            programming philosophy of MapReduce. The GATK provides a small
            but rich set of data access patterns that encompass the majority
            of analysis tool needs. Separating specific analysis calculations
            from common data management infrastructure enables us to optimize
            the GATK framework for correctness, stability, and CPU and memory
            efficiency and to enable distributed and shared memory
            parallelization. We highlight the capabilities of the GATK by
            describing the implementation and application of robust,
            scale-tolerant tools like coverage calculators and single
            nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling. We conclude that the GATK
            programming framework enables developers and analysts to quickly
            and easily write efficient and robust NGS tools, many of which
            have already been incorporated into large-scale sequencing

Recently, several techniques have been developed to count k-mers in large sequencing datasets, with a trade-off between the time and memory required to perform this function. We assessed several k-mer counting programs and evaluated their relative performance, primarily on the basis of runtime and memory usage. We also considered additional parameters such as disk usage, accuracy, parallelism, the impact of compressed input, performance in terms of counting large k values and the scalability of the application to larger datasets.We make specific recommendations for the setup of a current state-of-the-art program and suggestions for further development.}",

The amount of genetic variation discovered in human populations is growing rapidly leading to challenging computational tasks, such as variant calling. Standard methods for addressing this problem include read mapping, a computationally expensive procedure; thus, mapping-free tools have been proposed in recent years. These tools focus on isolated, biallelic SNPs, providing limited support for multi-allelic SNPs and short insertions and deletions of nucleotides (indels). Here we introduce MALVA, a mapping-free method to genotype an individual from a sample of reads. MALVA is the first mapping-free tool able to genotype multi-allelic SNPs and indels, even in high-density genomic regions, and to effectively handle a huge number of variants. MALVA requires one order of magnitude less time to genotype a donor than alignment-based pipelines, providing similar accuracy. Remarkably, on indels, MALVA provides even better results than the most widely adopted variant discovery tools.}

In a recent technical pilot, we compared the performance of traditional short-read sequencing with long-read sequencing in a small cohort of samples from the HapMap project and two AoU control samples representing eight datasets. Our analysis revealed substantial differences in the ability of these technologies to accurately sequence complex medically relevant genes, particularly in terms of gene coverage and pathogenic variant identification. We also considered the advantages and challenges of using low coverage sequencing to increase sample numbers in large cohort analysis. Our results show that HiFi reads produced the most accurate results for both small and large variants. Further, we present a cloud-based pipeline to optimize SNV, indel and SV calling at scale for long-reads analysis.
