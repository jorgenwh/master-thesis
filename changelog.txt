----- 10. and 11. may -----
- added a very small description of genotyping in the introduction (1
sentence).
- added Gerbil benchmark to results and a section in discussion about why it
is infeasible to use Gerbil in GKAGE.
- Re-wrote the CUDA memory hierarchy section.
- Changed the description of structural variants in background.
- Made some small changes to Thesis Goals.
- Made some small changes to the Methods introduction.
- Added a section in methods describing how the GPU accelerated components
were integrated into KAGE and how the components were benchmarked to assure
speedup. Additionally described in results how GPU genotyping did not result
in speedup after the new sparse solution was implemented for the CPU, thus not
being integrated into (G)KAGE.
- Re-wrote abstract.
- Some small changes to the background section about variants and variant
calling.
- Re-wrote most of the genotypes and genotyping section in background.
- Re-wrote parts of results' benchmarking section.
- moved thesis goals to the end of the introduction.
