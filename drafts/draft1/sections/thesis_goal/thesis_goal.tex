The goal of this thesis is to explore whether state-of-the-art genotyping can be sped up in any significant way by utilizing GPUs.
More specifically, this thesis will investigate whether alignment-free genotyping, which presently is significantly faster compared to alignment-based genotyping, can be sped up by the GPU.
In order to investigate this, I will attempt to integrate GPU accelerated functionality into a base genotyper, KAGE \cite{kage}, which is presently the fastest known genotyper that also yields good results.
The resulting GPU accelerated genotyping software, GKAGE, will then be benchmarked against KAGE to account for any potential speed up.
Finally, I will discuss elements about the work process and implementations, discuss possible future work and conclude the work presented in this thesis.
