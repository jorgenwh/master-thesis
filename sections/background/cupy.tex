\subsection{CuPy} \label{background:cupy}
CuPy is GPU accelerated NumPy \cite{numpy} and SciPy \cite{scipy} compatible array library that, much like NumPy \cite{numpy}, provides a multi-dimensional array object as well as mathematical functions and routines to operate on these arrays.
In fact, CuPy's interface is designed to closely follow that of NumPy, meaning that most array-based code written in NumPy can trivially be replaced with CuPy to GPU accelerate the array operations.
CuPy, unlike NumPy, will store all array data in GPU memory and all array routines will be performed by the GPU.
