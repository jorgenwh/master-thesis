\subsubsection{GPUs in Computers}

Two main computer GPU setups are prominent today: \textit{integrated} graphical processing units (iGPUs), and \textit{discrete} graphical processing units (dGPUs).
iGPUs are GPUs integrated onto the same die as a computer's CPU, where the two share the same physical \textit{Random Access Memory} (RAM) unit.
dGPUs are dedicated GPU devices that are physically distinct from the host computer's CPU and RAM, and have their own physical RAM.
dGPUs are significantly more powerful in terms of compute throughput when compared to iGPUs.
However, having their own physical RAM introduces an overhead;
Memory buffers with input data must be copied to the dGPU's RAM before processing, and results copied back from the dGPU's RAM to the host RAM.

For the work presented in this thesis, only dGPUs were utilized. 
Therefore, the term GPU will from here on out be referring to a dGPU and not an iGPU.
This means that all GPU implementations discussed in this thesis will include copying memory back and forth from the \textit{host} (CPU) RAM and the \textit{device} (GPU) RAM.
It is also possible for a single computer to have several connected GPUs, allowing for further parallelization of both memory transfers and compute, however this was not utilized in this thesis' work.
