\subsubsection{BioNumPy} \label{background:implementation_tools_and_libraries:bionumpy}
BioNumPy is a Python library built on top of NumPy that allows for easy and efficient representation and analysis of biological data \cite{bionumpy}.
This includes functionality for efficiently and correctly reading a multitude of different file types that are commonly used for storing biological data directly into NumPy arrays, fast encoding from character arrays representing biological sequences into 2-bit encoding for faster processing and better memory efficiency, and \textit{k}mer analysis support.
