\subsubsection{C and C++} \label{background:implementation_tools_and_libraries:c_and_cpp}
C and C++ are compiled general purpose programming languages.
C++ is a superset of C, and can in effect be considered to be C with classes among some other high-level functionality.
C and C++ are popular choices for implementing optimized and performant code.
They offer granular control over hardware and memory, where data such as arrays must be manually allocated and de-allocated.
