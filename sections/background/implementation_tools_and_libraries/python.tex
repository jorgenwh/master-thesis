\subsubsection{Python} \label{background:implementation_tools_and_libraries:python}
Python is an interpreted high-level general purpose programming language that has gained significant traction, including in the scientific computing community, in recent years \cite{python,python_popular}.
Since it is an interpreted language, Python in and of itself is not performant, and can in many instances be measured to be several orders of magnitude slower than similar implementations in performant compiled languages such as C and C++.
The Python interpreter is written in C, and thus, the Python programming language can naturally be extended with additional C and C++ code.
Because of its high-level and interpreted nature, it is well suited for quick prototyping of software.
However, because of its ability to be extended with additional C and C++ code, many packages exist today that supplement Python with high-performance libraries, making Python a serious language candidate for scientific computing software today, albeit through calling upon optimized and performant C and C++ code.
