\subsubsection{Snakemake} \label{background:snakemake}
Snakemake \cite{snakemake} is a workflow management system built on top of Python that allows for the creation of reproducible and scalable data analyses.
This is achieved through creating \textit{workflows}, using a human readable, Python based scripting language.
Such workflows are created as sets of rules, where each rule define how to produce one or more output files from one or more input files, for example by running a piece of software.
Once a workflow has been defined, Snakemake determines the order of which rules should be executed in order to produced the desired output.
Snakemake also ensures that workflows are reproducible by tracking input files, output files, and parameters used for executing rules, and parallelization of rule execution.
