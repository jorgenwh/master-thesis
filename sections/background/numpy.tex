\subsection{NumPy} \label{background:numpy}
NumPy is a scientific computing library for Python that provides support for fast multi-dimensional arrays along with a multitude of mathematical and other types of functions to operate on arrays efficiently \cite{numpy}.
NumPy works as a Python interface to fast C and C++ code that implements the underlying functionalities.
This underlying code relies on vectorization and SIMD instructions to perform array operations fast. 
While NumPy's standard functionality is designed to run efficiently on a single CPU core, multithreading can be utilized to both parellalize on the local data (SIMD) and the total work level (multithreading) at the same time.
Its flexible and easy-to-use interface along with its highly performant solutions that supports a wide range of hardware has made it a popular choice for any array-based scientific computing in Python.
