\subsection{Drawbacks of Graphical Processing Units}

While GPUs can be excellent for accelerating many problems in scientific computing, they do come with some notable caveats.

Expensive; power hungry; have experienced significant fluctuation in price and ease of access in the last couple of years (although seemingly mostly because of mining?); can be difficult to make effective solutions for someone inexperienced with the GPU compute models and frameworks; not suitable for every problem, only problems that are possible to rephrase as massively parallel, and it can be difficult to judge whether a problem is suitable before trying
