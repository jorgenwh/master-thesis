A central problem in biology is to effectively uncover and characterize genomic sequence varitaions in humans.
By understanding where and how the human genome varies from individual to individual, and how to accurately determine which genetic configurations an individual has, we can vastly improve our understanding of how an individual's genomic makeup affects its observable traits - its phenotype.
Additionally, as the price of high-throughput sequencing has steadily become cheaper over the last few decades, whole genome sequencing of human genomes has become more accessible than ever.
It is not uncommon to receive millions of short polynucleotide reads (often of length $\sim$ 150) when high-throughput sequencing a human genome today.
From just such reads, where we neither know where the read originates from in the sequences genome or where it may be erroneous, we want to perform the difficult task of characterizing the genomic sequence variations present in the sequenced genome.
