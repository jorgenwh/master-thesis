\subsection{GPU Accelerating \textit{k}mer Counting}
While several \textit{k}mer counting solutions have been developed in previous work, with at least one having support for GPU acceleration \cite{kmer_counting_tools}, most such tools are designed to solve the \textit{full} \textit{k}mer counting problem, which we described in section \ref{background:kmers_and_kmer_counting}.
Additionally in section \ref{background:kmers_and_kmer_counting}, we described how KAGE's \textit{k}mer counting step is a less compute and memory demanding problem which we defined as \textit{partial} \textit{k}mer counting.
As a reminder: we defined \textit{partial} \textit{k}mer counting as the process of only counting the observed occurences of a predefined set of \textit{k}mers in a sample.
Repurposing \textit{k}mer counting tools that are designed to solve the \textit{full} \textit{k}mer counting problem is futile if the goal is speedup.
Thus, we opted to implement our own GPU accelerated \textit{k}mer counting tool where its design is considered in the context of the \textit{partial} \textit{k}mer counting problem.

Although we had success in GPU accelerating a hash table in NumPy Structures using CuPy, we decided to also attempt to implement a hash table directly in C++ using CUDA, Nvidia's programming platform.
This would allow for more granular implementation as we would no longer be constrained to a solution originally designed for NumPy array functions.

%\subsubsection{Design Requirements and Choices}
%When designing our new GPU accelerated \textit{k}mer counting solution for KAGE, we had to keep in mind that we were in effect replacing a single component of KAGE, its \textit{k}mer counting solution, with our new GPU accelerated solution.
%Therefore, a necessary requirement for the new GPU accelerated solution was that it would need to exhibit indistinguishable behaviour to the previous solution in KAGE (except for runtime).
%In KAGE, the original solution was designed to receive chunks of \textit{k}mers to count in serial in order to restrict memory consumption.
%A chunk, an array of some parameter \textit{N$_c$} number of \textit{k}mers, is counted before a new chunk is generated by reading more data from the genomic data file, 2-bit encoding the sequences and extracting all valid \textit{k}mers (\textit{k}mer hashing).
%Additionally, our GPU accelerated solution must be functional directly in Python, as KAGE is written in Python.

%In order to support counting large chunks of \textit{k}mers at a time, we decided to base our solution on a hash table data structure with support for massively parallel counting of \textit{k}mers as they arrive in large chunks.
%Using a hash table data structure on the GPU immediately disqualifies certain common paradigms such as open hashing - where each address in the table contains a pointer to a linked list or a tree-type data structure.
%This is because GPUs, which architecture's are best designed for massive data parallelism performs poorly when having to dereference pointers and performing many strided memory accesses.
%Our hash table did not need to support changing the key-set after initialization, since we always have a predefined set of \textit{k}mers that we want to count the occurences of.
%We decided to implement the hash table in C++ using CUDA, Nvidia's programming platform \ref{background:graphical_processing_units:programming_model_and_cuda}.
%This would grant us much granular control over the implementation and hardware compared to the CuPy-based method described in section \ref{methods:initial_testing}.
%Since the hash table would be implemented in C++, we determined to use pybind11 \cite{pybind11} to create Python bindings for our C++ hash table, allowing us to extend its functionality into Python-based KAGE.

\subsubsection{Implementation}
%Unlike the hash table used in the previous method, this hash table uses a simpler open addressing with linear probing scheme for insertions, updates and queries.
%The hash table data structure is thus a simple structure of arrays, with one array constituting the hash table keys and another the associated values (counts).
%It is implemented in CUDA as a C++ class and supports the following functionalities:
%\begin{compactitem}
%  \item key insertion: only performed once upon initialization.
%  \item key counting: for each key, if it exists in the hash table, increment the associated hash table value by one.
%  \item key querying: for each key, if it exists in the hash table, fetch the associated hash table value.
%\end{compactitem}

%Each of these methods are implemented using custom CUDA kernels, allowing for each operation to happen for a large number of \textit{k}mers in parallel on the GPU.
%Thus, the insertion, counting and query implementations all expect arrays of \textit{k}mers where a single CUDA thread is assigned to each \textit{k}mer to fulfill the insertion, count update or query.

The hash table's interface needed to support three main operations: 1) \textbf{insert} - insert each \textit{k}mer found in an input array of \textit{k}mers (although only once upon initialization), 2) \textbf{count} - increment the value associated with each \textit{k}mer found in an input array of \textit{k}mers, and 3) \textbf{query} - fetch the values associated with each \textit{k}mer found in an input array of \textit{k}mers.

Common for all three operations mentioned above is that they need to adhere to an addressing and probing scheme.
Since our hash table resides on the GPU, certain common paradigms such as open hashing - where each address in the table contains a pointer to a linked-list or tree-type data structure for placing values - are immediately disqualified.
This is because GPUs, which architectures are designed for massive data parallelism, performs poorly when needing to de-reference pointers and make many strided memory accesses.
Thus, we went with a simple open addressing with linear probing scheme. 

Two arrays of equal size makes up the data structure where one array stores the table's keys (\textit{k}mers) and the other array stores its values (counts).
The keys array is an array of 64-bit unsigned integers.
The choice of using 64 bits for the keys, as opposed to \textit{i}.\textit{e}. 32, was to accomidate for larger \textit{k}mer values since 32 bits would only allow for \textit{k} up to $(32/2)-1=15$.
Using 64-bit keys increases our maximum \textit{k} size to 31, which is the default value for KAGE.
This choice also reveals a limitation of our hash table, which is that it can not support \textit{k}mers where $k>31$ in its current form.
The reason why 64 bits does not allow for \textit{k} up to 32, considering a 2-bit encoded 64-mer can be stored in a single 64-bit integer, is that the max 64-bit integer value is used as an indicator that a slot is empty in the hash table.
The values array is an array of 32-bit unsigned integers.
While 16-bit unsigned integers would suffice for our purpose of counting \textit{k}mers, the choice of using 32-bit unsigned integers instead was made because the CUDA framework does not have a readily usable implementation of the atomicAdd function for 16-bit integers.

The probing scheme we used - linear probing - describes how we solve collisions in the hash table. 
This scheme is common for all three operations supported by the hash table: insert, count and query.
A murmur hash \cite{murmur} is used to hash and compute the first search index for a \textit{k}mer.
The initial probe index $p_0$ and every consecutive probe index $p_i$ for a \textit{k}mer $k$ can be found using:
\begin{equation}
  p_0=hash(k) \bmod c \hspace{7em} p_{i}=(p_{i-1}+1) \bmod c
\end{equation}
where $hash$ is the murmur hash function and $c$ is the capacity of the hash table (the length of the arrays).
