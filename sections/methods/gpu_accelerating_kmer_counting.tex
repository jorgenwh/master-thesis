\subsection{GPU Accelerating \textit{k}mer Counting}
While several \textit{k}mer counting solutions have been developed in previous work, with at least one having support for GPU acceleration \cite{kmer_counting_tools}, most such tools are designed to solve the \textit{full} \textit{k}mer counting problem, which we described in section \ref{background:kmers_and_kmer_counting}.
Additionally in section \ref{background:kmers_and_kmer_counting}, we described how KAGE's \textit{k}mer counting step is a less compute and memory demanding problem which we defined as \textit{partial} \textit{k}mer counting.
As a reminder: we defined \textit{partial} \textit{k}mer counting as the process of only counting the observed occurences of a predefined set of \textit{k}mers in a sample.
Utilizing \textit{k}mer counting tools that are designed to solve the \textit{full} \textit{k}mer counting problem is futile, and we therefore opted to implement our own GPU accelerated \textit{k}mer counting tool where requirements and design are considered in the context of the \textit{partial} \textit{k}mer counting problem.

\subsubsection{Design Requirements and Choices}
When designing our new GPU accelerated \textit{k}mer counting solution for KAGE, we had to keep in mind that we were in effect replacing a single component of KAGE, its \textit{k}mer counting solution, with our new GPU accelerated solution.
Therefore, a necessary requirement for the new GPU accelerated solution was that it would need to exhibit indistinguishable behaviour to the previous solution in KAGE (except for runtime).
In KAGE, the original solution was designed to receive chunks of \textit{k}mers to count in serial in order to restrict memory consumption.
A chunk, an array of some parameter \textit{N$_c$} number of \textit{k}mers, is counted before a new chunk is generated by reading more data from the genomic data file, 2-bit encoding the sequences and extracting all valid \textit{k}mers.
Additionally, our GPU accelerated solution must be functional in Python, as KAGE is written in Python.

In order to support counting large chunks of \textit{k}mers at a time, we decided to base our solution on a hash table data structure with support for massively parallel counting of \textit{k}mers as they arrive in large chunks.
Our hash table did not need to support changing the key-set after initialization, since we always have a predefined set of \textit{k}mers that we want to count the occurences of.
We decided to implement the hash table in C++ using CUDA, Nvidia's programming platform \ref{background:graphical_processing_units:programming_model_and_cuda}.
This would grant us much granular control over the implementation and hardware compared to the CuPy-based method described in section \ref{methods:initial_testing}.
Since the hash table would be implemented in C++, we determined to use pybind11 \cite{pybind11} to create Python bindings for our C++ hash table, allowing us to extend its functionality into Python-based KAGE.

\subsubsection{Implementation}
From a bird's eye view, our GPU accelerated \textit{k}mer counter object consists of

Unlike the hash table used in the previous method, this hash table uses a simpler open addressing with linear probing scheme for insertions, updates and queries.
The hash table data structure is thus a simple structure of arrays, with one array constituting the hash table keys and another the associated values (counts).
It is implemented in CUDA as a C++ class and supports the following functionalities:
\begin{compactitem}
  \item key insertion: only performed once upon initialization.
  \item key counting: for each key, if it exists in the hash table, increment the associated hash table value by one.
  \item key querying: for each key, if it exists in the hash table, fetch the associated hash table value.
\end{compactitem}

Each of these methods are implemented using custom CUDA kernels, allowing for each operation to happen for a large number of \textit{k}mers in parallel on the GPU.
Thus, the insertion, counting and query implementations all expect arrays of \textit{k}mers where a single CUDA thread is assigned to each \textit{k}mer to fulfill the insertion, count update or query.

  As an array of \textit{N} 64-bit integer encoded kmers are counted by the hash table, \textit{N} CUDA threads will launch and each will compute the first probe position $p_0$ for its assigned kmer \textit{k}. Then, if the key at slot $p_0$ does not contain \textit{k}, it will continue probing by linearly moving up to the next consecutive slot until either an empty key or \textit{k} observed. If an empty key is observed, the thread terminates without changing any of the hash table's values. If \textit{k} is observed, the current slot's value is incremented.
