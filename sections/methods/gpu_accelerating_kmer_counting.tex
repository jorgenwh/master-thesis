\subsection{GPU Accelerating \textit{k}mer Counting}
While different GPU accelerated \textit{k}mer counting solutions such as Gerbil \cite{gerbil} have been developed in previous work, we opted to develop our own \textit{k}mer counting method because the \textit{k}mer counting problem solved in KAGE is slightly different than the typical \textit{k}mer counting problem described in section \ref{background:kmers_and_the_kmer_counting_problem}.
Rather than counting the frequency of every observed \textit{k}mer in the input reads, or even the frequency of every observed \textit{k}mer where the frequency is larger than some threshold, KAGE is only interested in counting the observed frequencies for a predetermined set of \textit{k}mers.
This revised problem is easier to solve in practice because the memory constraints are significantly less.
In the interest of brevity, we will refer to the typical \textit{k}mer counting problem described section \ref{background:kmers_and_the_kmer_counting_problem} as \textit{full kmer counting}, and the simpler problem where we only count the frequencies of a predetermined set of \textit{k}mers as \textit{partial kmer counting} \ref{methods:gpu_accelerating_kmer_counting:partial_kmer_counting}.
