\subsection{Integration into KAGE} \label{methods:integration_into_kage}
Previously in section \ref{methods}, we described how we implemented GPU acceleration for three components of KAGE: the \textit{k}mer hashing, \textit{k}mer counting and genotyping components.
Several different methods were explored, and some yielded better performance than others.
Common for each GPU accelerated component is that they were GPU accelerated in isolation to keep their modular behaviour identical to the non-GPU accelerated versions.
Thus, each accelerated component could be used as drop-in substitutes for their non-GPU counterparts in KAGE.

For each component, we selected the GPU accelerated version using the method that yielded the best runtime and integrated it into KAGE.
The selected methods can be seen in table \ref{methods:integration_into_kage:tables:chosen_methods} below.

  The implementations chosen to be integrated into KAGE for GPU acceleration.
  The GPU accelerated \textit{k}mer hashing and \textit{k}mer counting components were integrated into the \textit{kmer\_mapper} program, while the GPU accelerated log of the probability mass function was integrated into the \textit{kage} program.

Recall from section \ref{background:kage}, that KAGE is composed of two separate pieces of software: \textit{kmer\_mapper} - performing the \textit{k}mer hashing and counting, and \textit{kage} - performing the genotype-probability computations supported by the \textit{k}mer counts provided by \textit{kmer\_mapper}.
We substituted \textit{kmer\_mapper}'s \textit{k}mer hashing and \textit{k}mer counting components, and \textit{kage}'s LOGPMF function, with our GPU accelerated version.
Additionally, in the final GPU accelerated version of \textit{kmer\_mapper}, the \textit{k}mer hashing component delivered the resulting \textit{k}mer arrays directly to the \textit{k}mer counting hash table, thus, avoiding needless data copying between the host and the GPU.
As a result, \textit{kmer\_mapper} only encounters the overhead of copying data between the host and the GPU once, copying the raw input buffer read from the FASTA file to the GPU. 
Then, 2-bit encoding, \textit{k}mer hashing and \textit{k}mer counting are all performed directly on the GPU.

The final GPU accelerated version of KAGE, composed of the GPU accelerated versions of \textit{kmer\_mapper} and \textit{kage}, was ultimately named GKAGE (GPU KAGE).
