\subsection{Integration into KAGE} \label{methods:integration_into_kage}
In section \ref{methods:gpu_accelerating_kmer_counting}, \ref{methods:gpu_accelerating_kmer_hashing} and \ref{methods:gpu_accelerating_genotyping} we developed GPU accelerated alternatives for three components in KAGE.

Explain how GPU accelerated components were integrated into KAGE and how speedup means yes good good and how GPU acc genotyping was faster but got outcompeted by a new solution.
