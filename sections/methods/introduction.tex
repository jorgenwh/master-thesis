In this section we describe how GPU acceleration support was provided for the KAGE genotyping pipeline, resulting in GKAGE - a version of KAGE where parts of the pipeline is GPU accelerated.
We will give an account of how we determined which parts to focus on GPU accelerating, and describe a testing strategy that we deployed that allowed us to GPU accelerate existing NumPy code directly in Python to see whether significant runtime speedup was plausible.
Then, we will describe how we implemented the solutions that were introduced into KAGE, resulting in GKAGE.
