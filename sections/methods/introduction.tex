In this section we describe how GPU acceleration support was provided for the KAGE genotyping pipeline, resulting in GKAGE - a version of KAGE where parts of the pipeline is GPU accelerated.
We will go over different methods of GPU accelerating some of the NumPy based components present in KAGE, some of which require no CUDA or C++ code whatsoever.
