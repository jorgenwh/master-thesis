\subsection{bioRxiv Manuscript}
As a part of this master's project, we, along with the KAGE developers, wrote a manuscript presenting GKAGE \cite{manuscript}.
This manuscript has been deposited to bioRxiv - the preprint server for biology \cite{biorxiv}.
The manuscript, \textit{Ultra-fast genotyping of SNPs and short indels using GPU acceleration}, presents GKAGE as a software tool and briefly details the runtime speedup gained over KAGE and how GKAGE was implemented.
This makes GKAGE a contribution to international bioinformatics research, contributing to cutting down the time and cost of genotyping.
The full manuscript can be found in appendix \ref{appendix:manuscript}.
