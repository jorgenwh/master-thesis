\subsection{bioRxiv Preprint}
As a part of this master's project, we published a preprint \cite{preprint} in biorxiv - the preprint server for biology.
The preprint, \textit{Ultra-fast genotyping of SNPs and short indels using GPU acceleration}, presents GKAGE as a software tool and briefly details the runtime speedup gained over KAGE and how GKAGE was implemented.
The preprint article can be found in appendix \ref{appendix:preprint}.
