\subsection{GPU Acceleration Methods}
In our expedition to GPU accelerate components of the KAGE genotyping pipeline we found three distinct methods for GPU accelerating existing Python code based on NumPy.
Each method has its own unique set of advantages and drawbacks that we gained insight into during our project.
A more detailed discussion about their advantages and drawbacks will take place in section \ref{discussion:advantages_and_drawbacks_of_methods}.
