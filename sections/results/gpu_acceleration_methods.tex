\subsection{GPU Acceleration Methods}
In our expedition to GPU accelerate components of the KAGE genotyping pipeline we found three distinct methods for GPU accelerating existing Python code based on NumPy.
%Each method has its own unique set of advantages and drawbacks that we gained insight into during our project.
Each method was revealed to have certain advantages and drawbacks.
Through practical experimentation, we have uncovered interesting insight into how these methods can be utilized to accelerate a potentially vast field of existing tools by both developers and researchers.
%of how these methods can be deployed, and what type of problems they can be used for in order to GPU accelerate existing software, may be valuable to the scientific community.
%A more detailed discussion about each method's advantages and drawbacks will take place in section \ref{discussion:advantages_and_drawbacks_of_methods}.
