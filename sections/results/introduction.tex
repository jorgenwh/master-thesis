The following section will describe the benchmarks and results from this master's project.
The benchmarking results provided in this chapter were determined by running the associated pieces of software on two systems: one high-end compute server, which will be referred to as \textit{system 1}, and one consumer desktop computer, which will be referred to as \textit{system 2}.
