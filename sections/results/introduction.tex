The following section will describe the results yielded from this master's project.

All benchmarking results presented in this chapter were determined by running the associated pieces of software on the following set of computers and then comparing the results.

\subsection{\textit{K}mer parsing from raw reads}
% make more precise reference to where GPU support for bionumpy is described
In section () I described how I implemented GPU support for parts of BioNumPy \cite{bionumpy} in order to allow for GPU acceleration when when parsing \textit{k}mers from raw reads in FASTA files.
In short: BioNumPy reads and parses chunks of \textit{k}mers from FASTA files by 
1) reading a chunk of raw bytes from the FASTA file, 
2) converting each DNA nucleotide found in the raw read data into 2-bit encoded representations (\ref{background:nucleotide_binary_encoding}), 
and 3) parsing all valid \textit{k}mers of the desired size from the 2-bit encoded reads data.

After copying the raw bytes read from the FASTA file directly to the GPU, steps 2) and 3) could be performed significantly faster on the GPU for large enough chunk sizes.
