\subsection{\textit{K}mer parsing from raw reads}
Section (methods:cupy...) describes how GPU support was implemented for parts of BioNumPy \cite{bionumpy} in order to allow for GPU acceleration when when parsing \textit{k}mers from raw reads in FASTA files.
In short: BioNumPy reads and parses chunks of \textit{k}mers from FASTA files by 
1) reading a chunk of raw bytes from the FASTA file, 
2) converting each DNA nucleotide found in the raw read data into 2-bit encoded representations [\ref{background:nucleotide_binary_encoding}], 
and 3) parsing all valid \textit{k}mers of the desired size from the 2-bit encoded reads data.

After copying the raw bytes that were read into memory from the FASTA file directly to the GPU memory, steps 2) and 3) could be performed significantly faster on the GPU for large enough chunk sizes, given the high throughput of the GPU.
