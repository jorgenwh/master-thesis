\subsection{Published Preprint}
As a part of this master's project, we (my supervisors and I) published a preprint \cite{preprint} in biorxiv - the preprint server for biology.
The preprint, \textit{Ultra-fast genotyping of SNPs and short indels using GPU acceleration}, presents GKAGE as a software tool and briefly details the runtime speedup gained over KAGE and how GKAGE was implemented.
The preprint article can be found in appendix ... (\textbf{add appendix}).
